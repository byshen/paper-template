\section{Threat model}
\label{sec:threat}

\ace targets on reducing the possible attacks that aim to steal data by
exploiting the over-privileged access introduced by a sysadmin mistakenly 
over-grant the privilege to users or the permissions of resources, e.g., 
sysadmins give a database user higher level of privilege and the user 
(attacker) can view or modify the database which should not be accessed.
A number of recent studies 
\cite{bauer2009real,bauer2011detecting,Schneier2009,sinclair2010s,xu2017system}
have shown that such misconfigurations in the access control are prevalent and 
can cause severe consequences.


\ace aims to reduce the over-privileged resolutions introduced by the 
sysadmins in solving the common access-deny issues, by providing more 
critical information in the log messages for the sysadmins. First, \ace assumes 
that the sysadmins are the benign party. Second, \ace assumes that the error 
logs should be enabled by the system settings and accessible to sysadmins. This 
assumption is reasonable since the error logs record most critical information 
and usually enabled in the default settings. Third, \ace assumes the integrity 
of the error logs is guaranteed by the systems and will not be modified by 
malware or attackers.
